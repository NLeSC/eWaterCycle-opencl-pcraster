The central module of the PCRaster system is the group of PCRaster
operations where the operations for Cartographic Modelling
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2939344"></a>
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2934131"></a>
are integrated at a high level with the GIS functions of the package. The main
GIS functions supported are user interfaces (i.a. screen display, hard copy
output), conversion of data with other GIS packages and database
management. No digitizing  
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2934059"></a>
and scanning
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2918258"></a>
functionalities are implemented, but data transfer
to and from other GIS packages that support these functionalities is simple.
Spatial data are stored in the database as <span class="emphasis"><em>PCRaster maps</em></span>, this is a
binary format used for representation of raster maps in PCRaster.
</p><p>


The Cartographic Modelling part consist of operators for the static
analysis of maps. This set of operators follows the concept of Map
Algebra  
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2934410"></a>
and Cartographic Modelling. There are
several versions of Map Algebra, all with different names, but the
concept used in PCRaster is strongly related to the concept of the MAP
package designed by Tomlin (<a class="xref" href="bi01.html#tomlin80" title="The Map Analysis Package (draft manual)">[7]</a>,
<a class="xref" href="bi01.html#tomlin90" title="Geographic Information Systems and Cartographic Modelling">[8]</a>) and the algebra used by <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#berry87b" title="Beyond Mapping: Concepts, Algorithms, and Issues in GIS">[1]</a>. The Cartographic Modelling part
consists of a set of primitive operators that induce a change in the
properties of the cells, where the change in properties is calculated on
the basis of some kind of dependency within cells (point operations)
or between cells (neighbourhood operations, area operations, map
operations). An extensive set of operators is available in the PCRaster
system: several point operators (analytical and arithmetical functions,
Boolean operators, operators for relations, comparison, rounding, field
generation etc.), neighbourhood operators for calculations in moving
windows (highpass filtering, edge filtering, moving averages, etc.),
area operators for calculations within specified areas (for instance soil
groups), operators for the calculation of cost paths. In the PCRaster
package a rich suite of geomorphological and hydrological functions is
available that goes behind the range of operations generally considered as
Map Algebra. These include functions for visibility analysis, catchment
analysis and routing of transport (drainage) of material in a catchment
using interactively generated local drain direction maps and transport
(routing) operations.
</p><p>
This set of operators is a computer language designed especially for
spatial and temporal analysis. It is an algebraic language, which means
that the PCRaster operations can be applied and combined in the same way
as algebraic calculations. In general an operation is done by typing:

</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p><br>
<b>pcrcalc</b> <span class="emphasis"><em>Result</em></span> = PCRasterOperator(<span class="emphasis"><em>PCRasterExpression</em></span>)<br>
</p></div></div><p>

where <b>pcrcalc</b> activates the PCRaster operation shell
and PCRasterOperator is one of the PCRaster operations resulting in
the <span class="emphasis"><em>Result</em></span>. The <span class="emphasis"><em>Result</em></span>
may be a map or a non spatial value. The operation is done on the
map <span class="emphasis"><em>PCRasterExpression</em></span>. This map is called an
<span class="emphasis"><em>Expression</em></span> because it may be a map, but it may also
be a PCRaster operation or a set of operations that result in a map
or a non spatial value. This means that several PCRaster operations
may be nested in one command. For instance the maximum slope on a
slope map generated on basis of the elevation map Elevation can be
calculated in one command line using the <b>mapmaximum</b>
and <b>slope</b> operators by typing:

</p><pre class="programlisting"> pcrcalc Result = mapmaximum(slope(Elevation)) </pre><p>

As explained above, the separate commands are applied from the command
line. Additionally, by linking these commands into PCRaster scripts or
programs, it is possible to perform a theoretically unlimited number of
commands consecutively. This is usually referred to as (static) Cartographic
Modelling. Cartographic Modelling does not have a concept of time:
several operations are performed consecutively, but they do not necessarily
represent a process over time: the operations performed represent one,
static change in the property of cells.
