The operator creates a local drain direction map using the 8 point pour algorithm with
flow directions from each cell to its steepest downslope neighbour.
It determines for each cell its neighbour cell to whom material
(for example water) will flow to. Each cell on the local drain direction
map <code class="varname">Result</code> is assigned an arrow pointing to this downstream cell. This
is the local drain direction of the cell. These directions linked to each other
results in a local drain direction network: the flow pattern on the map. The
directions are coded according to the standard codes used for the local
drain direction data type:


</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a name="figlddvalues"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 18. Direction of ldd values. A value 5 (not shown) defines a cell without a local drain direction (a pit)</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="screen"> this "figures/lddcode.eps" figure placeholder</pre></div></div><br class="figure-break"></div><p>
</p><p>
Coincidently, the values resemble the layout of the numeric key pad
of your computer. A code 5 represents a pit, which is a cell
without a local drain direction; it is surrounded by cells draining towards
the cell. Additionally each catchment on <code class="varname">Result</code> ends with a pit cell at
the edge of the map, this cell is considered to be the outflow point of the
catchment.


</p><p>

For each cell, the local drain direction is determined on basis of the
elevation cell values on the digital elevation model <code class="varname">elevation</code>, in a 3 x
3 cells window with the cell under consideration in the centre. Dependent
on the elevation of the centre cell with respect to its 8 surrounding cells,
the local drain direction is determined as follows: if a cell has one or more
neighbours with a lower elevation on <code class="varname">elevation</code> it is assigned the local
drain direction to the neighbour cell which results in the steepest drainage
slope. If two or more neighbouring cells with the steepest drainage slope
can be found, the local drain direction is randomly chosen, to one of these
cells.


</p><p>

A cell may have neighbours which are at the same elevation as the cell
under consideration. One cell of this kind or a set of neighbouring cells of
this kind represent a flat area. Two types of flat areas may occur. The first
type is bordered on one or more sides by one cell or a set of cells at lower
elevation. Flat areas of this type are filled in with local drain directions
iteratively, starting at the edge of the flat area bordered by an area at a
lower elevation: each time the local drain direction is determined for one
of the cells on the flat area which has one or more neighbour(s) with a
local drain direction not pointing back into the cell under consideration.
The local drain direction of the cell under consideration will be in
direction of one of these cells (randomly chosen).


</p><p>

The second type of flat area is a flat area surrounded by cells at higher
elevation. Flat areas of this type are iteratively filled in with local drain
directions starting at the edge of the flat area and assigning drain directions
to cells which have neighbours draining into the cell under consideration.
Each iteration, a cell is assigned a drain direction to one of its
neighbouring cells on the flat area. The result of resolving flat areas of this
type is a map in which all cells are assigned a drain direction, except one
cell which is a pit.


</p><p>

Pits are defined as those cells that only have neighbours at higher elevation
than the cell under consideration, or a cell somewhere in the centre of a
flat area which is surrounded by cells at higher elevation, as foresaid.
Therefore, pits are those cells that only have neighbours pointing towards
them, and no neighbours at lower or equal elevation that they can point to.


</p><div class="figure-float" style="float: left;"><div class="figure"><a name="figpitremove"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 19.

</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><pre class="screen"> this "figures/demldd.eps" figure placeholder</pre></div></div><br class="figure-break"></div><p>
</p><p>

Pits can be removed by assigning artificial local drain directions to
depressions which do not have an outlet, see <a class="link" href="rn01re53.html#figpitremove" title="Figure 19.  A sprinkling of the few definitions used in theory of pit removing.">Figure</a>. The catchment of
a pit is circumscribed by the divide; this is a line which draws a boundary
between cells that drain to the pit and cells that drain to one of the
neighbouring catchments. For a pit which will be removed, the upstream
path from the pit over the local drain directions towards and over the
divide is determined which crosses the divide moving through cells at the
lowest possible elevation. The cell on this path at the highest elevation is
called the outflow cell, its elevation corresponds with the overflow level
of the catchment of the pit. Now, the pit is removed by reversing the
original local drain directions on this upstream path to the outflow cell.
Water for instance which falls in a certain cell in the catchment is removed
from the catchment by tracing the local drain directions as follows: first
it moves over the original local drain directions towards the pit; then it
leaves the catchment by following the traversed local drain direction path
upstream to the outflow cell and then downstream into the neighbouring
catchment.


</p><p>

The choice whether a pit must be removed or not depends on by what a
pit is caused by. Most of the pits will be due to data errors in the digital
elevation model <code class="varname">elevation</code>, grid mismatch or lack of resolution. These
artificial pits must be removed. Additionally pits can be caused by natural
phenomena: they can occur at the lowest point in depressions in a
landscape. For a proper analysis it is important to
maintain these natural pits as real pits on the local drain direction map.
The choice whether a pit is removed or not can be made dependent on the
dimension of the core of the pit. The core of a pit is the zone which
contains all cells in the pit catchment with an elevation lower than the
outflow level, see <a class="link" href="rn01re53.html#figpitremove" title="Figure 19.  A sprinkling of the few definitions used in theory of pit removing.">Figure</a>. The dimensions of a pit core can be defined by
core depth, core volume, core area and catchmentprecipitation. The core depth of a pit is
the overflow level of a pit minus the elevation of the pit cell, see <a class="link" href="rn01re53.html#figpitremove" title="Figure 19.  A sprinkling of the few definitions used in theory of pit removing.">Figure</a>.
The core volume of a pit is defined as the total volume that is needed
to fill up the core area to the overflow level. The core area of a pit is the
area of the cells in a core. The catchment precipitation is the amount of
rainfall in a pit catchment needed for filling up a pit core, assuming that
all water which falls in the pit catchment accumulates in the core. It is
defined by the volume of a core divided by the area of the catchment of
a core. Using these pit core dimensions the choice is made whether a pit
is resolved or not: for each pit cell the core depth, core  volume, core area
and catchmentprecipitation in millimetres are calculated. If all of these values are smaller
than the threshold values on respectively <code class="varname">outflowdepth</code>, <code class="varname">corevolume</code>,
<code class="varname">corearea</code>,<code class="varname">catchmentprecipitation</code> at the pit cell under consideration,
the pit will be removed; if one value is larger or equal it will not be removed.


</p><p>

In general artificial pits will be relatively small compared to pits which are
considered to be natural features of the landscape. So, the pit core
dimension thresholds permit for distinguishing between these two sorts of
pits. Additionally some pits of a certain size can be removed from your
map while keeping other pits of the same size. This can be done by
choosing dimension threshold values which are different for each pit on
your map. Try different values and use the PCRaster operators
interactively by running <b>lddcreate</b> with different combinations of
<code class="varname">outflowdepth</code>, <code class="varname">corevolume</code>,<code class="varname">corearea</code>,<code class="varname">catchmentprecipitation</code>
each time adjusting the thresholds.

A cell with missing value on one or more of the input expressions is
totally ignored during operation of <b>lddcreate</b>; it is assigned a missing
value on <code class="varname">Result</code>.

Here, a somewhat generalized description of pit removing is given. For a detailed description,
