PCRaster is a Geographical Information System which consists of a set of
computer tools for storing, manipulating, analyzing and retrieving
geographic information. It is a raster-based system that uses a strict data
type checking mechanism. This means that data type information is added
to all spatial data, based upon the kind of attribute that the data represent.
The use of data types controls the way the data are stored in the database
and the possibilities for manipulation and analysis of the data. This strict
data type checking mechanism has the advantage that it helps the user to
organize the data and prevents the execution of operations that will make
a nonsense result. The spatial data types implemented discriminate between
various types of continuous fields and classified objects.

PCRaster has a relatively open database. The architecture of the system
permits the integration of environmental modelling functions with
classical GIS functions such as database maintenance, screen display and
hard copy output.  The modules for Cartographic and Dynamic Modelling
are integrated with the GIS at a high level, which means that the GIS
functions and modelling functions are incorporated in a single GIS and
modelling language for performing both GIS and modelling operations.
</p><p>
The modules for geostatistical modelling (gstat module) and error
propagation (ADAM module, not described in this manual) are
integrated at a medium level with the GIS part of the package: both 
use a separate set of functions for manipulating the data; the map format
of the central database is used and files can be automatically exchanged
between the modules and the GIS part of the package. Exchange of ascii
files with any other modelling or GIS package can be done using PCRaster
conversion operations.

The central concept of PCRaster is a discretization of the landscape in
space, resulting in cells of information.  Each cell
 
<a class="indexterm" name="id2907892"></a>
can be regarded as a set of attributes defining its properties, but
one which can receive and
transmit information to and from neighbouring cells. This representation
of the landscape is often referred to as 2.5 D: the lateral directions
in a landscape are represented by a set of neighbouring cells making
up a map; relations in vertical directions, for instance between soil
layers, are implemented using several attributes stored in each cell.
GIS operations or operations used in modelling can be regarded as
functions that induce a change in the properties of the cells on
the basis of the relations within cells (between attributes on one
cell location) or between cells, see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#fig2.2" title="Figure 1.1.  The cell: relations between attributes within the cell and relations in lateral directions with attributes stored in neighbouring cells.">Figure 1.1</a>. In
PCRaster, each functional module of the package represents a group of
operations that change the properties of the cells in a specific way.
A short review of the modules will be described (<a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html" title="1.2. GIS and Cartographic Modelling">Section 1.2</a> to <a class="xref" href="ch01s05.html" title="1.5. ADAM module: error propagation">Section 1.5</a>) and after that the hardware requirements and how to install PCRaster on a computer will be explained (<a class="xref" href="ch01s06.html" title="1.6. Hardware and software requirements, installation">Section 1.6</a>)
